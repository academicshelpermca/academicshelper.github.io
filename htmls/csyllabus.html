        <h2> Programming and Problem Solving Syllabus </h2>
        <h3> Course Description</h3>
        <p> This is a first course in programming which intends to introduce students to the foundations of computing,
            programming and problem-solving. Aim is to develop basic programming skills necessary for engineering
            education. Students would learn C/C++ programming in Unix/Linux environment. This course has a associated
            lab with it. </p>
